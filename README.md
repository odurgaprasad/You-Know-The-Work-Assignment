# You-Know-The-Work-Assignment


This is an HTML code for a resume webpage. The webpage includes a container with three rows, each row containing two columns.

The first row includes a profile section with an icon of a user, followed by the name and profession of the individual. The second column in this row contains a brief description of the individual and their address, phone number, and website.

The second row contains a work section with an icon of a briefcase, followed by three different job experiences listed chronologically, starting from the most recent. Each job experience is listed with a year range, followed by the job title, and a brief job description.

The third row includes a skills and awards section with an icon of a clipboard, followed by a list of skills in the first column, and a corresponding set of points in the second column to rate the proficiency of the individual in each skill.

The HTML code uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome for styling and icons. The CSS file "index.css" is linked to this HTML code to customize the webpage's layout and design.
