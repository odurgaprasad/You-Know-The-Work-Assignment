# You-Know-The-Work-Assignment


This is an HTML code that creates a webpage. The webpage includes a header with links to external CSS and JavaScript files. The body of the webpage is divided into three sections using the Bootstrap grid system. The first section is the profile section, which includes the name, profession, and a brief description of the person. The second section is the work section, which includes a list of the person's work experience with brief descriptions. The third section is the skills and awards section, which includes a list of skills with ratings and awards received.

The HTML code uses Font Awesome for icons and Bootstrap for layout and styling. It also uses custom CSS from a separate file, style.css, to modify the Bootstrap styles and add additional custom styles.
